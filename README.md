# GCD-Course-Project

This is the Github repo for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera.

The R Script, run_analysis.R, does the following,

1. Read and merges the training and test sets into 1 data set
2. Extracts only activities that have mean or std measurements
3. Renames columns to meaningful activity names for the measurements
4. Labels data set with descriptive variable names
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set
